# Welcome to gamUploader!

The purpose of gamUploader is to automatically upload, and open MS Office files in the right Google Workspace app in Chrome.

gamUploader was created by me (Kim Nilsson), in collaboration with GAMADV-XTD3 developer Ross Scroggs.

## Recognition
gamUploader.exe included with this package is based on [GAMLite](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMLite), a special version of [GAMADV-XTD3](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3), which only contains the code to perform the actions described above. GAMADV-XTD3 is a free, open source command line tool for Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) Administrators to manage domain and user objects quickly and easily.

The included gamUploader.exe is just the python script compiled with pyinstaller, [as described in the wiki](https://github.com/NoSubstitute/gamUploader/wiki/Compile-your-own-gamUploader-(optional)), and is definitely virus free, regardless what your AV says.
