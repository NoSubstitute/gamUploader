<b>You need to read all of these instructions to know what you need to do to make gamUploader work.</b><br><br>
gamUploader will be unpacked in C:\gamUploader<br>
After the installation, Notepad will open gamUploader.bat.<br>
Replace your email address on line 3.<br>
<br>
It looks like this.
<br>
USERADDRESS=ReplacewithYour@EmailAddress<br>
<br>
Then close and save the file.<br>
<br>
The <b>gamUploader.bat</b> file is to be set as the default app for all files that are to be uploaded, and edited in Drive, by autoloading the first Chrome Profile (Default), which should be your work account. Else the PROFILE variable on line 11 in the gamUploader.bat also needs to be edited.<br>
<br>
So, to make this work, we need to associate gamUploader.bat with your Office files.<br
That can be done Manually or Automatically.<br><br>
<b>Completely Automatically:</b> After you close the gamUploader.bat file, you will be asked if you want to allow the C.\gamUploader\association\gamUploader_association.reg to change the registry. Press Ok to accept. Done!<br>
<b>Automatically:</b> Double click the file C:\gamUploader\associations\gamUploader_association.reg and accept the changes in the registry.<br>
<b>Manually:</b> Right-click, or double-click, on one of each of your MS Office file types (Word, Excel, Powerpoint), and choose <b>Open With</b>, browsing to and selecting C:\gamUploader\gamUploader.bat, and set it to always open.<br>
<br>
In the future, depending on which file type is double clicked, the URL returned will be different.<br><br>
Word documents, ending with docx or doc will open with:<br<
https://docs.google.com/document/d/%%i/edit
<br><br>
Excel files, ending with xlsx or xls will open with:<br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/%%i/edit
<br><br>
PowerPoint files, ending with pptx or ppt will open with:<br>
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/%%i/edit
<br><br>
Unknown/Unmapped filetypes that are associated with or dropped on this bat file will instead load this URL:<br>
https://drive.google.com/file/d/%%i/edit
<br><br>
That will show the content in a preview mode, if Drive is able to. If not, it'll just say the file is incompatible with Drive, and must be downloaded to view or edit.<br>
