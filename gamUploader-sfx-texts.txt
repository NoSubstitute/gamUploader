gamUploader is to be unpacked in C:\gamUploader<br>
After installation, Notepad will open gamUploader.bat.<br>
Replace your email address on line 3.<br>
<br>
USERADDRESS=ReplacewithYourEmailAddress<br>
<br>
Then close and save the file.<br>
<br>
This file <b>gamUploader.bat</b> is to be set as the default app for all files that are to be uploaded, and edited in Drive, by autoloading the first Chrome Profile (1), which should be your work account. Else the --profile-directory variable needs to be edited.<br>
Depending on which file type is double clicked, the URL returned will be different.<br>
Word documents, ending with docx or doc will open in Chrome with:<br>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/%%i/edit<br>
<br>
Excel files, ending with xlsx or xls will open in Chrome with:<br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/%%i/edit<br>
<br>
PowerPoint files, ending with pptx or ppt will open in Chrome with:<br>
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/%%i/edit<br>
<br>
Unknown/Unmapped filetypes that are associated with or dropped on this bat file will instead load this URL in Chrome:<br>
https://drive.google.com/file/d/%%i/edit<br>
That will show the content in a preview mode, if Drive is able to.<br>
If not, it'll just say the file is incompatible with Drive, and must be downloaded to view or edit.<br>
<br>
So, to make this work, you should right-click, or double-click, on each of your MS Office file types, and choose <b>Open With</b>, browsing to and selecting C:\gamUploader\gamUploader.bat, and set it to always open.<br>
